                    UBI is an economic model to ensure each contributor to the platform is fairly rewarded in proportion
                    to their contribution. In Musicoin's context, a UBI pool is created to secure musicians' income from
                    PPP on the platform, at a fixed rate that is fair, uninfluenced by market forces and higher than
                    that of any other competing streaming platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will boost the influx of content from musicians as well as make streaming music free for
                    listeners, therby ensuring deeper penetration of Musicoin into the streaming market. Unlike other
                    streaming platforms, users on the Musicoin platform will be able to stream songs for free and
                    without ads
