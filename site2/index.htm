The Musicoin Blockchain ensures each musician receives the most competitive industry compensation, instantly and automatically, for each stream of music.</p>
        <p> Musicoin uses the blockchain to power a decentralized, peer-to-peer, platform. It allows us to host music available to everyone and transactions that are transparent and secure. It also means that there are no third-parties involved and musicians get 100% of the revenue from their streams.</p>

            <h2>Free streaming</h2>
            <p>
        You can stream our catalog of music from independent musicians. Absolutely free, and absolutely without ads. You're probably wondering how our platform is both free for listeners, and at the same time pays musicians better than any streaming service currently available. We accomplish this by leveraging the blockchain to remove intermediaries an implementing a model called Universal Basic Income (UBI) that supports both listeners and musicians.

            <p>
        The concept of sharism is a revolutionary philosophy that incorporates wisdom from the studies of Epistemology and Axiology. It emphasizes the importance of sharing knowledge and value within a community to create a positive social impact. In other words, everyone is valued and is necessary to Musicoin, the listeners, the developers, the outisde providers and of course the musicians.
